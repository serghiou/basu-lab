### Questions

* What is the prediction task? Is it binary or continuous?
* How come RF performed so much better than XGB?
* Why not an RNN?

### Notes

* RFs worked much better than ARIMA and RNNs - RNNs would need many more parallel timelines
* Prediction of count data on log-transformed data introduces bias (apparently)
